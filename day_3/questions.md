## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a boolean operator where based on a true or false assessment, a sequence of code is either executed or not. 
a. if weight > 500
    p 'The chair is broken'
end
b.  if car = 'fast'
        p 'The car crashed'
    end
c.  if weather = 'sunny'
        p 'We will go hiking today'
    end

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
We would want to use an if statement to judge whether or not a statement is true and execute some code based on that assessment. 
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if statement
    code to be executed
end
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
the && and || orporators allow to do "if this and this", and if this but not that"
1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
color = 'blue'
empty = true
if empty == true
    p 'The tank is empty'
elsif color == 'blue'
    p 'the car is blue'
else
    p ' the car isn't blue or empty'
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
do while statements allow us to run a loop until a certain condition has been met
